<h2>Clone and run the Epic CSS 11ty theme</h2>

1. Make a project directory and navigate to it if you don't already have one.

    ```sh
    mkdir my-blog-name
    cd my-blog-project
    ```
2. From your new directory folder clone the [Epic CSS 11ty Theme](https://github.com/jeremyfaucher/epic-css-11ty-theme) from GitHub.

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/jeremyfaucher/epic-css-11ty-theme.git
    cd epic-css-11ty-theme
    ```

3. Install dependencies

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4. Run Eleventy to start the server and follow to the localhost URL http://localhost:8080/.

    ```sh
    npm run start
    ```

    The `npm run start` command will fire up `eleventy --serve` and watch for any changes to your files. Changes will be auto updated in the browser for fast iterating.

    You will see a folder named `my-epic-css` with and index.scss file in `src` folder, where you can customize your Epic CSS integration.

## Build a light version of your CSS

In your Epic CSS 11ty theme project root folder, you will see the `epicConfig.js` file. This is to configure a light build and will correspond with the Epic CSS 11ty theme folder structure.

```js
    module.exports = {
    // Project source folder where HTML, Nunjucks, or PHP files are located from root
    projectDir: './src',
    // Where your epic CSS theme lives from root
    epicThemeDir: './src/my-epic-css',
    // The directory where your CSS file will be saved
    projectStyleDir: './src/_includes',
    // The name of the final CSS file
    outputFileName: 'style.css'
    };
```

In the package.json file you will see the `epic-build` and `epic-light` commands. These are to update the pre-light.css file, and output a light version of the style.css file.

```js
"epic-build": "node ./node_modules/epic-css/src/epic-build.js",
"epic-light": "node ./node_modules/epic-css/src/epic-light.js"
```

3. Run `npm run epic-build` to update the pre-light.css file to your project, that the `epic-light` command can use to compare to your project file results.

4. Then run `npm run epic-light` to search your project files from the `projectDir` and filter out the found classes against pre-light.css class, then build a lightened version of your project style.css.

This will take the current Epic CSS UI library from 1426 lines of CSS down to only 303 lines of CSS for the Epic CSS 11ty theme. This gives you access to all the UI library styles during development and publishing only the styles you use in your project for production.
